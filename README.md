# My misc projects!

Hey! I see you've made it to this repo.

This is code that may or may not work, but i really didn't want to trow away. So use it at your own risk ;) 

The projects include:

- **Game Counter:** Two bars set to count from 8000 down, can be set to count from anywhere using @[number]
- **Minesweeper:** If you've never played it, you're missing out!
- **Network Monitor:** Sample code for checking network status right from vala
- **Coder:** For when you need to pass text into hardcoded code, but are too lazy to do so
- **Cookie:** Cookie Clicker clone made in vala (This was my very first "app")
